# Fairberry

The goal of this project is to add a BlackBerry Q10 keyboard to non-BlackBerry phones. While this can easily be adapted to suit any other phone with an USB port at the bottom, I will focus on releasing files for the Fairphone 4, since that is what I have. Feel free to adjust it to your phone and share your results in the discussion area.

The Fairberry keyboard is detachable and can be used without any modifications on the phone. Since it connects over USB, there is no need for separate batteries or glitchy Bluetooth connections.
